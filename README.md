Overview
This project implements a text summarization algorithm using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python. The goal of this project is to provide a summary of a given text by extracting the most significant sentences. This technique is useful for quickly understanding the key points of large documents.

Features
Text Tokenization: Splits the input text into words and sentences.
Frequency Analysis: Calculates the frequency of each word, excluding common stopwords.
Sentence Scoring: Scores sentences based on the frequency of the words they contain.
Summary Extraction: Extracts the most important sentences to generate a concise summary.
How It Works
Text Tokenization: The text is tokenized into words and sentences using NLTK's word_tokenize and sent_tokenize functions.
Frequency Table: A frequency table is created to keep track of word occurrences, excluding common stopwords.
Sentence Scoring: Each sentence is scored based on the sum of frequencies of the words it contains.
Summary Generation: Sentences with scores above a certain threshold (1.2 times the average score) are selected to form the summary.
